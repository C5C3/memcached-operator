  "implementation_notes": "This feature follows the standard Kubebuilder pattern for webhook certificate management with cert-manager. The architecture has three layers:\n\n1. **Base webhook manifests** (config/webhook/): Contains the generated MutatingWebhookConfiguration and ValidatingWebhookConfiguration manifests (already exist) and the webhook Service (already exists). These are NOT modified — they remain clean for envtest.\n\n2. **Cert-manager resources** (config/certmanager/): New directory containing a self-signed Issuer and a Certificate that provisions a TLS cert for the webhook Service DNS name. The Certificate's secretName (webhook-server-cert) is what the manager Deployment mounts.\n\n3. **Default overlay patches** (config/default/): Patches that wire everything together — CA injection annotations on webhook configs, volume mount on the manager Deployment, and Kustomize replacements to substitute the correct namespace/name values.\n\nThe webhook server in cmd/main.go already creates a webhook.NewServer with TLS options. Controller-runtime's default CertDir is /tmp/k8s-webhook-server/serving-certs, and the default port is 9443. No changes to Go code are needed — this is purely a Kustomize/manifest change.\n\nKey files to reference:\n- cmd/main.go:63 — webhook server creation (already exists, no changes needed)\n- config/webhook/service.yaml — webhook Service (already maps 443→9443)\n- config/webhook/manifests.yaml — generated webhook configurations (already exist)\n- config/default/kustomization.yaml — main overlay to update\n- internal/controller/suite_test.go — envtest setup (uses WebhookInstallOptions, not affected)\n\nRisks:\n- Kustomize replacement syntax must exactly match the annotation placeholder values; a mismatch causes silent failures where CA injection does not work\n- The namePrefix 'memcached-operator-' must be accounted for in cert-manager resource names and DNS names\n- If cert-manager is not installed on the target cluster, the deployment will create Certificate/Issuer resources that remain pending — this is expected and documented\n\nThe envtest suite reads webhook manifests from config/webhook/ (not config/default/), so cert-manager patches in config/default/ do not affect test execution.",
