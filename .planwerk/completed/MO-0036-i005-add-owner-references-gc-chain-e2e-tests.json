  "description": "**Size:** 📦 medium\n**Category:** testing\n**Priority:** medium\n**Source:** Proposed for 'E2E tests with chainsaw are now working. Analysis'\n\nAdd 1 comprehensive Chainsaw E2E test that validates owner references on ALL operator-managed resources:\n\n**test/e2e/owner-references/**: Create a CR with monitoring + PDB + NetworkPolicy all enabled to maximize child resource creation. Explicitly assert `ownerReferences` on every child resource:\n- Deployment: ownerReference with correct owner UID, kind=Memcached, name matches CR\n- Service: same ownerReference assertions\n- PodDisruptionBudget: same ownerReference assertions\n- NetworkPolicy: same ownerReference assertions\n- ServiceMonitor: same ownerReference assertions\n\nThis validates the Kubernetes garbage collection chain — when the parent CR is deleted, all child resources must be cleaned up. The existing cr-deletion test verifies deletion happens, but this test explicitly verifies the mechanism (ownerReferences) is correctly set on creation.\n\n**Rationale:** Owner references are the foundation of Kubernetes garbage collection. If any child resource lacks correct ownerReferences, it becomes orphaned on CR deletion, leading to resource leaks. The existing cr-deletion test only checks the end result, not the mechanism. Explicit ownerReference validation catches bugs in new resource creation code paths before they cause orphaned resources in production.\n\n**Affected Areas:**\n- test/e2e/owner-references/chainsaw-test.yaml",

  "implementation_notes": "This test validates the mechanism (ownerReferences) rather than the outcome (garbage collection) of Kubernetes resource cleanup. The operator sets ownerReferences via `controllerutil.SetControllerReference()` in `internal/controller/reconcile_resource.go:46` for ALL managed resources. Chainsaw's partial object matching allows asserting specific ownerReferences fields without knowing the UID at test-write time — Chainsaw matches array entries by matching fields, so we assert kind, apiVersion, name, controller, and blockOwnerDeletion. The UID is dynamic and cannot be hardcoded, but Chainsaw will verify the ownerReference entry exists with all specified fields regardless of UID value. The CR is modeled after `test/e2e/cr-deletion/00-memcached.yaml` but adds NetworkPolicy enablement (`security.networkPolicy.enabled: true`) to cover all 5 resource types. Test name `test-owner-refs` follows the `test-{feature}` naming pattern used across all E2E tests.",
