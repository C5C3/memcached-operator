However, it includes Go test files that validate documentation accuracy against the actual CRD types.\n\n**File organization:**\n- `docs/index.md` — Central navigation page organized by Diataxis quadrants\n- `docs/explanation/architecture-overview.md` — Architecture explanation\n- `docs/reference/crd-reference.md` — Comprehensive CRD field reference (separate from the existing per-component reference docs in docs/reference/backend/)\n- `docs/how-to/installation.md` — Installation how-to guide\n- `docs/how-to/upgrade.md` — Upgrade how-to guide\n- `docs/how-to/troubleshooting.md` — Troubleshooting how-to guide\n- `docs/how-to/examples.md` — Annotated example CRs how-to guide\n- `config/samples/memcached_v1alpha1_minimal.yaml` — Minimal example CR\n- `config/samples/memcached_v1alpha1_ha.yaml` — HA example CR\n- `config/samples/memcached_v1alpha1_monitoring.yaml` — Monitoring example CR\n- `config/samples/memcached_v1alpha1_tls.yaml` — TLS example CR\n- `config/samples/memcached_v1alpha1_production.yaml` — Production example CR\n\n**Existing docs to reference but NOT duplicate:**\nThe `docs/reference/backend/` directory already contains 28 detailed reference docs for individual components (deployment-reconciliation.md, memcached-crd-types.md, tls-encryption.md, etc.). The new `docs/reference/crd-reference.md` provides a unified user-facing CRD field reference, while the existing docs serve as developer-facing implementation references. The index page should link to both.\n\n**Key patterns to follow:**\n- Match the format of `docs/reference/backend/memcached-crd-types.md` for field reference tables (columns: Field, Type, Required, Default, Validation, Description)\n- Use `**Source**: file paths` header convention from existing docs\n- YAML examples should match the CRD types exactly — use the actual Go types in api/v1alpha1/memcached_types.go as the source of truth\n- Example CRs should be consistent with config/samples/memcached_v1alpha1_memcached.yaml patterns\n\n**Test strategy:**\n- Tests validate that documentation stays in sync with code — if CRD types change, tests will fail until docs are updated\n- Sample CR validation uses the actual Kubernetes scheme and webhook validation functions\n- Doc example extraction parses YAML blocks from Markdown files\n- Link validation checks relative paths resolve to real files\n\n**Risks:**\n- CRD reference could become stale if types.go changes without updating docs — mitigated by validation tests\n- YAML examples could use incorrect field names — mitigated by deserialization tests with strict unknown field rejection\n- Links could break as docs structure evolves — mitigated by link validation test",
