# This patch adds the cert-manager.io/inject-ca-from annotation to the
# mutating and validating webhook configurations. This instructs cert-manager
# to inject the CA certificate from the specified Certificate resource into
# the webhook configurations, so that the API server trusts the webhook's
# serving certificate.
# The CERTIFICATE_NAMESPACE and CERTIFICATE_NAME vars are substituted by kustomize.
