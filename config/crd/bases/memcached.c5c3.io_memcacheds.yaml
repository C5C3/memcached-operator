                            MaxSkew describes the degree to which pods may be unevenly distributed.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=DoNotSchedule`, it is the maximum permitted difference
                            between the number of matching pods in the target topology and the global minimum.
                            The global minimum is the minimum number of matching pods in an eligible domain
                            or zero if the number of eligible domains is less than MinDomains.
                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/1:
                            In this case, the global minimum is 1.
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |   P   |
                            - if MaxSkew is 1, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone3 to become 2/2/2;
                            scheduling it onto zone1(zone2) would make the ActualSkew(3-1) on zone1(zone2)
                            violate MaxSkew(1).
                            - if MaxSkew is 2, incoming pod can be scheduled onto any zone.
                            When `whenUnsatisfiable=ScheduleAnyway`, it is used to give higher precedence
                            to topologies that satisfy it.
                            It's a required field. Default value is 1 and 0 is not allowed.

                            MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains.
                            When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains,
                            Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed.
                            And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains,
                            this value has no effect on scheduling.
                            As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                            scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                            If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1.
                            Valid values are integers greater than 0.
                            When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 2/2/2:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  |
                            The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0.
                            In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                            because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                            it will violate MaxSkew.

                            For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same
                            labelSelector spread as 3/1/1:
                            | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 |
                            | P P P |   P   |   P   |
                            If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled
                            to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies
                            MaxSkew(1). In other words, the cluster can still be imbalanced, but scheduler
                            won't make it *more* imbalanced.

                        description: |-
                          seLinuxChangePolicy defines how the container's SELinux label is applied to all volumes used by the Pod.
                          It has no effect on nodes that do not support SELinux or to volumes does not support SELinux.
                          Valid values are "MountOption" and "Recursive".

                          "Recursive" means relabeling of all files on all Pod volumes by the container runtime.
                          This may be slow for large volumes, but allows mixing privileged and unprivileged Pods sharing the same volume on the same node.

                          "MountOption" mounts all eligible Pod volumes with `-o context` mount option.
                          This requires all Pods that share the same volume to use the same SELinux label.
                          It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods.
                          Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes
                          whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their
                          CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively.
                          "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.

                          If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used.
                          If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes
                          and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

                          This field affects only Pods that have SELinux label set, either in PodSecurityContext or in SecurityContext of all containers.

                          All Pods that use the same volume should use the same seLinuxChangePolicy, otherwise some pods can get stuck in ContainerCreating state.

                        observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.

                        with respect to the current state of the instance.
