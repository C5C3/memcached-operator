  name: tls-mtls
spec:
  # Separate from tls-encryption to maintain test isolation: the TLS test validates
  # the base TLS configuration without client cert verification, while this test
  # validates the additional mTLS-specific resources (ca.crt projection, ssl_ca_cert arg).
  # A single test with a patch step would conflate the two configurations.
  description: >
    Verify that enabling TLS with enableClientCert creates the correct cert-manager
    Certificate, TLS volume with ca.crt, volumeMount, container args including
    ssl_ca_cert, and ports in the Deployment and Service (REQ-004, REQ-005, REQ-008, REQ-009).
