  description: >
    Verify that creating a Memcached CR with autoscaling.enabled=true produces
    an HPA with the correct scaleTargetRef, minReplicas, maxReplicas, default
    CPU metric, and default scaleDown behavior. The Deployment must exist but
    must NOT have a hardcoded replica count (HPA controls replicas)
    (MO-0042 REQ-001, REQ-006, REQ-007).
  timeouts:
    apply: 30s
    assert: 120s
    delete: 30s
